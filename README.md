# ServletAnnotationExample

The Servlet API 3.0 introduces a new package called javax.servlet.annotation which provides the annotation types which can be used for annotating a Servlet class. The annotations can replace the equivalent XML configuration in the web deployment descriptor file (i.e. web.xml) such as Servlet Declaration and Servlet Mapping. Servlet Containers will process the annotated classes at the time of application deployment.
